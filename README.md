# Carbon-Reduction-Helper

We believe that consumers want to reduce their carbon footprint but are not getting the right support to make informed choices.

Currently, busy people have to spend a lot of time either
<ul>
    <li>doing extensive internet research or</li>
    <li>entering lots of unnecessary data into a traditional carbon footprint calculator before suggesting any options.</li>
</ul>
 
We want to help the user focus on actions they want to do and guide them through the process.

By presenting a set of incremental before-after actions based on average UK consumers and their relative impact, consumers just have to select what they will do.

Once the user has selected the action they want to do they will be helped to complete the action by offering sources of information, products and services.

<h1>Organisation</h1>
The intention is that this code will be managed by a not-for-profit organisation such as a Community Interest Company that reflects our desire to help society do the right thing.
